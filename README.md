# Cash

A custom Linux shell in C, inspired by the old operating systems course code I found on my old laptop hard drive.

## About

Cash is a lightweight shell. Because it doesn't have that many features. It works though.

## Installation

```
make
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
./cash

# try things out
ls -la
echo "Hello from Cash!"
pwd 
```


## Roadmap, If I ever get there

- [ ] export, alias builtins
- [ ] piping
- [ ] make it configurable
